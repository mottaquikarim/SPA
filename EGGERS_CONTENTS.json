SPAs are a breed of websites where you load a HTML page (like index.html) only once. All the \"subpages\" are displayed with javascript, which allows us to do cool things like code page transition effects.\n\n### Project\n\nWe will be building a simple blog using the Trello API.\n\n## Topic Breakdown\n---\n\n### Why SPAs?\n\n* we will kick things off by discussing by SPAs are useful\n* we will also explore some examples of current SPAs in the wild (and some cool effects that they afford us)\n\n\n### Setting up an SPA \n\n* how to set up javascript to handle all page transitions\n* introduction to the concept of views and models\n* introduction to route handling in javscript\n\n\n### Routing handling 101\n* setting up code to listen for url change\n* document.onhashchange and how that can be used to trigger a javascript powered page \"reload\"\n* brief overview of the new HTML5 pushState/popState API (and what it means)\n\n\n### Templating and views\n* discussions on what a view is and how to build it\n* introduction to underscore.js and how it can be use to template out our views\n\n### Event handling in an SPA\n* how to write events for your different \"pages\"\n* how to organize your code when writing SPAs\n* using flux to handle unidirectional data flow\n","idx":0},"why-spas":{"content":"# Why SPAs\n---\n\n### Why are SPAs are useful\n\n### SPAs in the Wild","idx":1},"setting-up-an-spa":{"content":"# Setting up an SPA\n---\n\n### Faking page loads with JS\n\n### Views and Models\n\n### Handling routes","idx":2},"routing-handling-101":{"content":"# Route Handling 101\n---\n\n### Listening for URL change\n\n### Inserting new content\n\n### push/popState API\n\n","idx":3},"templating-and-views":{"content":"# Templating and Views\n---\n\n## what is a view\n\n## underscoreJS to generate views\n\n","idx":4},"event-handling-in-an-spa":{"content":"# Event handling in an SPA\n---\n\n## View specific events\n\n## Code organization\n\n## Data flow and Flux\n\n","idx":5},"title":{"content":"SPA: Single Page Applications","idx":6},"desc":{"content":"The rundown on how to build single page applications with javascript.","idx":7},"__list__":["home","why-spas","setting-up-an-spa","routing-handling-101","templating-and-views","event-handling-in-an-spa","title","desc"]}
